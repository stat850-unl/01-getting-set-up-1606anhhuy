Hello there, my name is Huy Ngo, and I am a firs-year ph.D. student. We met sometime in Zoom and in-person on last Friday. I am kind of a quiet man because I don't know what to say, and because I don't know what I have to say. I have some experience with computing like using Matlab and C++, but I still have some hard time to figure it out new things like SAS, and... yes, this assginment right here. How manytime did I spent on this? I don't know, but it has to be a long, long, long time. And right now, I still don't know if I am doing it right or not. 

I have some hobbies, one is write a story, and the other is think about how to write a story. Oh, and I like martial art, so if one day you see me in a hallway, doing some weird movement with my arms and legs, or doing some strange pose... just leave me there.
